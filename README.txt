ULTRA-SHORT STEPS (Windows)

1) Double-click: setup_and_build.bat
   - This creates a venv, installs deps, installs PyInstaller, and builds the EXE.
2) After it finishes, open: dist\MC Options Pricer.exe
3) Your browser opens the app (no internet needed).

If you already have a venv & pyinstaller, you can just run: build_exe.bat
